# Largest number possible

## Easy  |  Accuracy: 20.26%

<p>Given two numbers 'N' and 'S' , find the largest number that can be formed with 'N' digits and whose sum of digits should be equals to 'S'. Return -1 if it is not possible.</p>


# Example 1:

```bash
Input: N = 2, S = 9
Output: 90
Explaination: It is the biggest number 
with sum of digits equals to 9.
```

# Example 2:

```bash
Input: N = 3, S = 20
Output: 992
Explaination: It is the biggest number 
with sum of digits equals to 20.
```

<span>Your Task:</span>
<p>You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findLargest() which takes N and S as input parameters and returns the largest possible number. Return -1 if no such number is possible.</p>


```bash
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Exepcted Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
0 ≤ S ≤ 105
```
