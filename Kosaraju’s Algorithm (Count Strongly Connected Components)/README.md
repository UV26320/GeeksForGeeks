# Count Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju’s Algorithm)

## Problem statement
<p>You are given an unweighted directed graph having 'V' vertices and 'E' edges. Your task is to count the number of strongly connected components (SCCs) present in the graph.</p>
<p>A directed graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. The strongly connected components of a graph are the subgraphs which are themselves strongly connected.</p>
<p>Note :
Use zero-based indexing for the vertices.</p>

```bash
The given graph doesn’t contain any self-loops.
