# Check if Linked List is Palindrome

# Medium  |  Accuracy: 41.48%

<p>Given a singly linked list of size N of integers. The task is to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.</p>

# Example 1:

```bash
Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,2,1}
Output: 1
Explanation: The given linked list is
1 2 1 , which is a palindrome and
Hence, the output is 1.
```

# Example 2:

```bash
Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,2,3,4}
Output: 0
Explanation: The given linked list
is 1 2 3 4 , which is not a palindrome
and Hence, the output is 0.
```

<span>Your Task:</span>
<p>The task is to complete the function isPalindrome() which takes head as reference as the only parameter and returns true or false if linked list is palindrome or not respectively.</p>


```bash
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxialliary Space Usage: O(1)  (ie, you should not use the recursive stack space as well)
```
