# Print first n Fibonacci Numbers

# Basic  |  Accuracy: 29.92%

<p>Given a number N, find the first N Fibonacci numbers. The first two number of the series are 1 and 1.</p>


# Example 1:

```bash
Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 1 2 3 5
```

# Example 2:

```bash
Input:
N = 7
Output: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
```

<span>Your Task:</span>
<p>Your task is to complete printFibb() which takes single argument N and returns a list of first N Fibonacci numbers.</p>

```bash
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Note: This space is used to store and return the answer for printing purpose.

Constraints:
1<= N <=84
```
