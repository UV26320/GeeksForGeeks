# Power of 2

# Basic |  Accuracy: 32.58%

<p>Given a non-negative integer N. The task is to check if N is a power of 2. More formally, check if N can be expressed as 2x for some integer x.</p>


# Example 1:

```bash
Input: 
N = 8
Output: 
YES
Explanation:
8 is equal to 2 raised to 3 (23 = 8).
```

# Example 2:

```bash
Input: 
N = 98
Output: 
NO
Explanation: 
98 cannot be obtained by any power of 2.
```
