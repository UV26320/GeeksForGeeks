## Problem statement
<p>You have been given a directed weighted graph of ‘N’ vertices labeled from 1 to 'N' and ‘M’ edges. Each edge connecting two nodes 'u' and 'v' has a weight 'w' denoting the distance between them.</p>
<p>Your task is to calculate the shortest distance of all vertices from the source vertex 'src'.</p>
<p>Note:
If there is no path between 'src' and 'ith' vertex, the value at 'ith' index in the answer array will be 10^8.</p>

```bash
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= M <= 300
1 <= src <= N
1 <= u,v <= N
-10^5 <= w <= 10^5

Time Limit: 1 sec
```
